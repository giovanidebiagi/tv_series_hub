# Tv Series Hub Challenge

Application for listing TV Series, using the API provided by TVMaze. 

## Considerations
The APK file provided in the link below is a Fat APK, which means it contains binaries for multiple ABIs embedded within it. This allows the app to run on multiple architectures, but its drawback is that its file size is much larger (users download unnecessary files for their devices architecture).
Since the goal of this project is to create an app with a wide compatibility, not published to any stores (to which we usually generate app bundles, instead of APKs) and not necessarily size optimized, I've found it reasonable to generate a fat APK.

## APK Download

This app is not published to any store, however, there's a (fat) APK available in the following address:
